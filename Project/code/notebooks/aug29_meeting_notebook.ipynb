    "## Preliminary Notes:\n",
    "From the August 21 meeting, we established that a transformer model on the aggregated data with a dashboard alone was not sufficient because the amount of data was very small. Instead, we have pivoted to an LSTM/Transformer/DLinear model comparison with the following changes:\n",
    "- Consider a collection of neighboring counties. Grab the environmental variables from each of the other counties and use that data as extra columns in the feature vector.\n",
    "- What is the definition of neighboring counties? Well, we want to stretch this definition to three possible interpretations: \n",
    "  1. Contiguous connection\n",
    "  2. All of the central valley counties\n",
    "  3. All counties surrounding the central valley\n",
    "- From a recent paper, it seems rats and other rodents are carriers for Coccidioidomycosis. So look into getting rat spray data\n",
    "- Eventually convert this into a better dashboard (stretch goal)\n"
