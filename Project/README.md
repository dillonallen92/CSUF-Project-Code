# üå°Ô∏è Valley Fever & Wildfire Incidents: Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

This project explores the potential relationship between **wildfire incidents** and **Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)** case rates using a time series modeling pipeline built in **PyTorch**. The goal is to predict future VF case counts using historical trends, with fire data as a possible covariate.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the project**:

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the model**:
    ```bash
    cd code
    python main.py
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Edit `main.py` to set modeling options and pick the county:

```python
county_name   = "Tulare"      # Any valid CA county present in both datasets
lookback      = 12            # Number of months to look back
hidden_size   = 64
num_layers    = 2
dropout       = 0.2
epochs        = 300
